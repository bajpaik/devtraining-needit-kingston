        <description>This is an on Demand/Classless script include eg. where two integers are passed. These integers are added together and their sum is logged. &#13;
A Script Include that defines a single function is known as an on demand, or classless, Script Include. The function is callable from other server-side scripts. On demand Script Includes can never be used client-side even if the Client callable option is selected.&#13;
A script template is automatically inserted into the Script field. The template does not apply to on demand Script Includes. Delete the template and replace it with your function definition. The Script Include function is defined using standard JavaScript syntax.&#13;
It is critical that the Script Include name is an exact match for the name of the function. In the example, both the Script Include and the function are named onDemandScriptInclude. On demand Script Includes are typically used when script logic needs to be reused. Examples include standardizing date formats, enabling/disabling logging, and validating email addresses.&#13;
